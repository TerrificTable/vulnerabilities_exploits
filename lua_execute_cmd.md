# Execute Code with a lua command

##### < this even works without lua installed >

You will get a command that looks something like this ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/944354446337507358/956338060218470431/unknown.png)
if you havnt installed lua you will get something like this back: "bash: lua: command not found"
and still it has created a "hello" file<br>
containing: "Hello World!"
